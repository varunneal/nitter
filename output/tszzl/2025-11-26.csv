seems to get back to the “ancestral environment” of models (ie language ghosts) vs of humans (primates) and all the associated tics that one might learn. there are layers of training and optimization on top of the pressures of the ancestral environment, but it's still in there

hallucinations are something you would expect of the language ghosts but not of primates. being fooled by simple variations on word puzzles where the surface statistics of the language pattern seem to imply an answer reinforced thousands of times across the ancestral plains of the internet is something you might expect of a language ghost, but not a primate. (..The doctor is the boy's mother!..)

echolocation is something you would expect of the cetaceans but not of primates. a talent for skillful, embedded power-seeking (""situational awareness"") is something you would expect of primates but not of language ghosts
