with autonomous electric logistics you have trucks that can move much smaller loads on the last mile very cheaply (and perhaps more important, can engage with zero latency). we may find that intermediate production becomes more distributed over land rather than just over sea. factories and production facilities are spaced out according to land use efficiency with software defined cargo streams between them. ironically this may create more local jobs in the interim

while large scale autonomous warehousing has become common for walmart, amazon, etc you’d expect to see far more distributed nodes with an extreme explosion of local SKUs, and final construction closer to the site of demand. you would also expect the idea of returns, exchanges, etc becoming significantly easier and cheaper. ownership and purchase decisions of expensive things may begin to feel different

overall, massive containership ocean freight will continue to dominate just due to the simple laws of physics of friction over water vs over roads and so on. but expect far less friction for over land logistics",32,44,410,39041,,false
