1990578652216766880,https://x.com/tszzl/status/1990578652216766880,2025-11-18 00:31:48,"one thing that was immediately palpable in washington is that everyone has incredibly intense and baroque friend-enemy distinctions. there are whole catalogues, subgroups of people who we like and don't like. there is an exhaustive mental list of gossip and calculation about who is getting iced out of which circles and for what reason. there is paranoia about being associated with the wrong crowd. maybe if you are caught hanging out with writer X someone in the white house’s inner circle will deem you insufficiently patriotic and end your career. this all makes sense of course as political influence is a mostly zero sum game and requires all kinds of warfare to wield effectively. I got the distinct sense that the place would exhaust and ruin me very quickly, as someone who needs to meet someone twice before even remembering their name.

this is all very interesting coming from san francisco where commercial interests and market forces rein supreme and even companies who are purportedly competitors today have free movement of services and people between them. good relations must be maintained, you go to parties with your friends at the ‘enemy’ labs, and in general the market forces you to assume the best of everyone. ""best"" in a limited sense, which means - your counterparties are rational actors looking for nonzerosum profitable exchange, with asymmetric upsides. silicon valley encourages you to be broadly friendly with everyone, and make time for everyone due to the low but real chances of extreme upsides from these interactions. though of course there is some amount of intense strategy and gamesmanship at the highest levels, the rank and file rarely think about this.

both places attract the type of people who are capable of the kind of social interaction that is demanded by the respective environments and likely filters them very quickly. If you are too broadly trusting in washington, i am sure your head will end up on a metaphorical spike shortly thereafter. It also makes sense that everyone in dc seems to be undergoing a religious revival - encouraging extremely specific sectarianisms and beliefs - despite the underlying implication that everyone is having exciting and perhaps sordid personal lives. There is a warmth and spice of life to the ongoings in washington that reminds you of history, and the fukuyama quote:

""The end of history will be a very sad time. The struggle for recognition, the willingness to risk one's life for a purely abstract goal, the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination, and idealism, will be replaced by economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands.""",89,60,1294,317859,,false
