there are many contributing factors here and it’s not simple at all. to begin with, ethnic indians are a small and extremely successful minority in the US, as far as 'model minorities' go there's not even a close second. it paints a giant target on our backs regardless of anything else, especially in economic headwinds.

politically its a loser issue: neither side cares because courting indian american votes is not that important. the issue is only important to tech donors at best and it's not exactly like americans love technology right now. if all these companies were concentrated in swing states maybe it would matter idk. if you've noticed though, the visa system hasn't changed much, and trump has only spoken positively about skilled immigration.

there’s also the fact that indians pose the most credible demographic threat to the Anglophone world. India has the highest birth rates of any country in the world, doubling that of China. there is a enormous number of people who would like to come to the west and work for better wages. if free movement were allowed there would be massive demographic change and wash away the native cultures, and this obviously weighs heavily on some

indians in india are finally getting access to the internet and they have a pugilistic quality to them that actually sustains the race war and makes it ""fun"" for the white ethnats, who are similarly pugilistic in an interesting race to the bottom. many of the commenters don't understand the free speech cultural norms of america. frankly the white ethnonationalists have been kinder to me than when i loudly disagree with them than the indians in the past few days have, which is fine i don't care. i know what i'm saying is true because i'm pugilistic too i love fighting online. it's not because 'we lay down flat', that's the most boring kind of target

finally, i'm an individual. i'm roon. i have a complex political and technological project and defending the reputation of indian-americans online is not even among my top three priorities for what i'm doing here. i wouldn't massively burn the other priorities to do this, and it would be counterproductive to try anyways, because i think you misunderstand that ethnic minorities need to be loved not feared to have any long term success",30,8,282,52309,,false
