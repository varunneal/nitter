1984778812580905433,https://x.com/tszzl/status/1984778812580905433,2025-11-02 00:25:18,"most recently, there was this angry mix of hindus in india raging against the comments JD Vance made about his wife's religion. they bring their colonial grievances to any instance of christians proselytizing. they see in it the impositions of the british, the caliphates, and mother teresa and so on. even though that is core to the christian faith afaict and not at all any sort of overbearing influence in modern america - in fact, no peoples in the history of the world have ever been more accepting to the cultures and faiths of outsiders than the WASPs of america. there is no equivalent systematic proselytization in hinduism so it's seen as an act of aggression without recourse

in the context of the indian-american diaspora -- the vice president of the united states having a hindu wife and wanting her to join him in his newfound christianity is perfectly fine and makes a ton of sense, both politically and as a little private family religious tension. in america, people are always 'finding themselves' in various ways and obviously change over the course of a relationship. usha nee chilukuri had her rust belt yale law hillbilly husband become catholic and also a few years later the vice president of the united states, and they manage to make it all function. of course VP Vance believes his wife should share his beliefs, but is not capable of forcing her to do anything in the american individualist lineage. not such a bad situation

these are the kind of strange and beautiful life circumstances that only happen in america, constant doses of science fiction, transcendence, alienation. america is like an engine for spinning up these tremendously interesting intercultural narratives, each of which may be unique incidents in the history of the world. each of them are beautiful, painful and requires the individuals living in it to make sacrifices and new calculations about the future that will just not make sense to non-americans, and i'm not interested in their commentary",63,25,344,110851,,false
