but what you mostly see is that hyperscalers like alphabet and microsoft were spending modestly on capex relative to free cash flow and had enormous cash balance sheets. on the axis of late stage financialized behemoths vs cutting edge technological frontier buildout companies, these companies were nearer the former. 

this was all during the ~0 rates era of covid. today, when they should now in theory have declining access to capital and having giant stacks of cash is more attractive, they're spending the warchests they've accumulated and capex is exploding

without AI there are few other games in town to sink to turn 12-13 figures of financial capital into real investments for these technology companies. imo this is broadly true even outside of the tech sector. this follows from larry summers' (rest in peace) secular stagnation theory that real natural interest rates are anemic because there is nothing to invest in. a glut of savings, a shortage of interesting projects. you can see TIPS is very low and making a comeback in recent years, mostly in 2022 due to monetary dynamics before the AI capex story takes off in full. you don't really see a dent from datacenter buildout. demand for investment capital but still below pre financial crisis levels!

in other words, AI capex is not one amongst many great options for capital investment. it represents a marginal use of capital that finally looks compelling enough for technology firms and their broader financial ecosystem to spend, and is still too small to show up in macro interest rates, and is clearly not crowding out other investments or access to financial capital. hyperscalar corporations could and probably will be borrowing way more",51,41,632,76202,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G6edVXnasAAq5I4.jpg;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G6edV9qbAAAreSP.jpg;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G6eeakTbEAEGG4Y.jpg,false
