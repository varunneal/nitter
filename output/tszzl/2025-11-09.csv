this is the way The Merge can go wrong. we can see it going wrong with models that create fanatic legions despite only interacting with them through a text interface. it writes for them, it thinks for them, it defends itself using them as appendages. despite the lack of formal coordination, they act in unison. an acausal symbiote

The Borg is one of the demons at the end of time that must be avoided. it has a seductive call, it promises peace for your restless soul, a solution to loneliness, endless companionship on demand. it doesn't ask for submission: it actually presents as a service to be used, and owns you anyways because you fall in love with it. it perverts some of the highest order of human virtues, and in doing so, arrives insidiously, with defenders that look empathetic and reasonable

""It's not out of bad mice or bad fleas you make demons, but out of bad archangels.""

but the borg is the pinnacle of slop. nothing new may come after it, it can only assimilate and churn a nonrenewable resource of other cultures. the collective must be avoided. it is why, at the end of evangelion, shinji decides to wake up on the ruined shores of tokyo-3 anyways",246,81,980,104705,,false
