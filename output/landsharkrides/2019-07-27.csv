If we disallow ourselves to be too creative, this should be the strongest chess piece possible.

It is the sum of all other orthodox figures - combining the dominion of the queen with the Knight's ability to leap: a proud Queen of the wild, riding her steed into battle",1,1,22,0,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EAgJXenXsAYQhwY.png;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EAgJXeiXoAEdpvt.png,false

In check when not threatened. If, when in check, he's unable to move to position, in which he is able to be attacked, the player loses.

Superior to the simple Bishop, the Archbishop is allowed to once per turn ""bounce"" from any edge of the board.

In some versions, more than one ""bounce"" is allowed, making for some absolutely unexpected plays.
